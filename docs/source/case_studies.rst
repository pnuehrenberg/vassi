We tested the *vassi* package on :doc:`two datasets <2_example_datasets>`:

*CALMS21* dataset
=================

This is an existing dataset on mouse resident-intruder interactions by Sun et al. [CALMS21]_.

Refer to the :doc:`example datasets <2_example_datasets>` page on how to obtain this dataset.

*Social cichlids* dataset
=========================

We also provide a novel dataset with increased complexity for the automated scoring of social behaviors in animal groups.

This dataset consists of 9 videos with 15 individuals per group (of a cichlid fish species, *N. multifasciatus*).
For more details and the dataset, refer to our `data repository <https://doi.org/10.17617/3.3R0QYI>`_.

.. note::
    this is not yet finalized for the documentation.
